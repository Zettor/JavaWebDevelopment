   An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it! Common examples include compass directions (values of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST) and the days of the week.   Because they are constants, the names of an enum type's fields are in uppercase letters?   In the Java programming language, you define an enum type by using the enum keyword. For example, you would specify a days-of-the-week enum type as...
